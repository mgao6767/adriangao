# Mingze Gao's website

> 🍻 a minimalist personal site with some style and serious nonsense

## 🚀 Project Structure

This site is build with [Astro](https://astro.build) with the following structure:

```text
├── public/
├── src/
│   ├── components/
│   ├── layouts/
│   └── pages/
├── astro.config.mjs
├── README.md
├── package.json
└── tsconfig.json
```

Astro looks for `.astro` or `.md`/`.mdx` files in the `src/pages/` directory. Each page is exposed as a route based on its file name.

There's nothing special about `src/components/`, but that's where to place any Astro/React/Vue/Svelte/Preact components.

Any static assets, like images, can be placed in the `public/` directory.

## 🧞 Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:

| Command                | Action                                           |
