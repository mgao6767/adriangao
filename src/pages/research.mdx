## Publications

[Organization Capital and Executive Performance Incentives](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jbankfin.2020.106017), **_Journal of Banking & Finance_**, 2021, with Henry Leung (University of Sydney) and Buhui Qiu (University of Sydney).

  {/* "Go for the firm that an idiot can run!" - a firm with high organization capital (OC) does not need as much executive incentive pay.

  A tweak to the classic principal-agent model shows that a firm with high OC may reduce executive performance pay given that OC reduces the marginal effect of managerial effort on firm outcome.
  But since OC adds noise to the signal of managerial effort, higher performance pay may also be required to elicit managerial effort.
  We empirically show that the former dominates, i.e., OC has a substitution effect on executive performance incentives. */}

  {/* We use state-level unemployment insurance benefits as an instrumental variable
  for OC and show that the documented OC-PPS substitution effect is likely
  causal. Results are also robust to a stacked difference-in-differences
  estimation approach based on a quasi-natural experiment of exogenous CEO
  turnovers due to health-related issues. Our findings strongly suggest that
  greater OC substitutes for costly executive incentive compensation to sustain
  firm productivity and increase shareholder wealth. */}
