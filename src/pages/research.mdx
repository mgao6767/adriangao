## Corporate Finance

[Organization Capital and Executive Performance Incentives](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jbankfin.2020.106017), **_Journal of Banking & Finance_**, 2021, with Henry Leung (University of Sydney) and Buhui Qiu (University of Sydney).

<div class="text-sm ml-8 mb-6 border-l-2 pl-4 border-gray-300">
  We conjecture that a firm's organization capital (OC) has a substitution
  effect on its executive pay-for-performance sensitivity (PPS) and empirically
  document a robust and significant substitution effect of OC on executive PPS.
  We use state-level unemployment insurance benefits as an instrumental variable
  for OC and show that the documented OC-PPS substitution effect is likely
  causal. Results are also robust to a stacked difference-in-differences
  estimation approach based on a quasi-natural experiment of exogenous CEO
  turnovers due to health-related issues. Our findings strongly suggest that
  greater OC substitutes for costly executive incentive compensation to sustain
  firm productivity and increase shareholder wealth.
