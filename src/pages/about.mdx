Made in 1994. Married in 2021. Husband to [Sherry](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sherrybu/). Father of three cats.

I came to Sydney in 2013 and have since been with the University of Sydney.
Started with a commerce degree in econometrics and finance majors, I enjoy very much the study and life here and successfully completed my research degrees in finance afterwards. A fan of computer science too, I started my part-time study in computing and information technology at the neighbouring University of New South Wales during my postdoctoral research fellowship at USyd. 

My PhD work is summarsied by three papers. The first theoretically extends the principal-agent model and empirically shows that a firm's accumulated knowledge substitutes for costly executive performance incentives. The second involves textual analysis on millions of firm 8K filings and documents a positive effect of corporate real estate holdings on M&A performance. The third applies machine learning on high-dimensional bank loan data and proposes an effective early-warning predictor for bank risks, which forms the backbone of a successful [$500,000 grant](http://purl.org/au-research/grants/arc/DP210102611) from the Australian Research Council (ARC) Discovery Project financing my postdoctoral fellowship.

I'm blessed to have my wonderful supervisors over the past many years, SrLec. Henry Leung, A/Prof. Buhui Qiu, Prof. Joakim Westerholm and Prof. Eliza Wu,[^1] and the invaluable mentoring from Prof. Iftekhar Hasan. I strive to produce more high-quality research outputs myself and together with my awesome coauthors. To the best I can, I also like to provide as much as possible to all researchers so that we can thrive together, which motivates me writing the [research notes](/posts), [apps](/apps) and [more](/research#data--code). My favourite quote:

> Work until you no longer have to introduce yourself.

Of course, I enjoy more than what's listed above. But I wish to keep this site focused on the academic and professional side of me. Hope every one who happens to drop by this site finds it useful to some extent. If not, please feel free to contact me. My email can be found on the [home page](/).
