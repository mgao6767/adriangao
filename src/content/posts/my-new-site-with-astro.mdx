I've rebuilt my personal site with [Astro](https://astro.build).

## Some note

Thanks to Astro, I can now mix React (and other) components with normal Markdown content. As a result, for example, my apps [LeGao](/apps/legao) and [Option Pricing Explained](/apps/option-pricing-explained) are now integrated with the main site, which were separate React-based webpages.

Besides, with [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/), I'm now able to quickly apply and adjust styles as I like, but I'm keeping the styling to a minimal. Content is the most important.

I also replaced my CV page with a [PDF](/cv) for professionalism -- at the end of the day, I cannot tell any potential employer to visit my site instead of me handing over the PDF. On a side note, I did find myself struggling to get it work, initially. I thought I'd update the CV PDF often, and so used [Git LFS](https://git-lfs.github.com/) for tracking its changes. But it turns out that LFS replaces the file content with a hash text, which makes it impossible to view the PDF in the browser. I had to move away from LFS.

## Source code

import { GithubOutlined } from '@ant-design/icons'

<button
  class="text-2xl rounded py-1 px-[50px] border border-transparent bg-gray-200 w-100 hover:bg-orange-900 hover:border-orange-900 hover:text-gray-100 transition ease-in-out duration-200"
  onclick="location.href='https://github.com/mgao6767/adriangao'"
  type="button"
>
  <GithubOutlined />{' '}
</button>

All my site's source code and content are on GitHub. To build my site locally, simply run the following commands (with `Nodejs` and `npm` installed):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mgao6767/adriangao.git
cd adriangao
npm install
npm run dev
```

Configuration:

- Google Analytics v4 code is located at `src/components/BaseHead.astro`
- giscus comment code is located at `src/layouts/BlogPost.astro`

Happy hacking!
